/**
 * Injector Provider for integration tests with dynamic Ecore.
 *
 * While ESON supports Xcore, note that there is a test using this, the main
 * (no-test) ESON does NOT include Xtext's Ecore support, which indexes *.ecore,
 * due to perf concern, to avoid full scan of all *.ecore.  Should that ever be
 * of interest, then the dependency to the org.eclipse.xtext.ecore should be
 * made in core org.eclipse.emf.eson instead of only in org.eclipse.emf.eson.tests,
 * and a component = org.eclipse.xtext.ecore.EcoreSupport { } would have to be added
 * to the GenerateEFactory.mwe2.
